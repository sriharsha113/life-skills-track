# Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is a distributed search engine that was built based on the Lucene library. It is the most popular search engine which was developed in Java. It allows us to store, search, and analyze huge amounts of data quickly and give back answers in milliseconds. It will give fast search responses because instead of searching the text directly, it searches based on the index. It uses a structure based on documents instead of tables and schemas. And it comes with an extensive REST API for storing and searching the data.


# Solr 
Now, Solr is a search server that was built based on Apache Lucene, similar to Elasticsearch. It also utilizes Java for development. Solr will intake queries which are simple HTTP request URLs and give the response back to us in the JSON format. It performs several operations which include indexing, querying, mapping, and ranking to search a document. Its features include full-text search, database integration, NoSQL features, and rich document handling. It is developed collaboratively so that users can interact with it by using different web applications.


# Lucene
Apache Lucene is a free and open-source search engine software library that was written in Java. It is widely used as a base foundation for producing several search engines which include Elasticsearch and Solr as well. Projects like  Apache Solr, Elasticsearch, Nutch, and Kinosearch were built based on it. we can achieve fast search responses because, instead of searching the text directly, it searches an index instead.


# Conclusion

So, to wrap it up, we have looked into Elasticsearch, Solr, and Lucene, which are all really cool search tools based on the Lucene library.

- **Elasticsearch** stands out as a distributed search engine with extensive features for storing, searching, and analyzing large amounts of data. It utilizes a document-based structure and provides fast search responses through indexing and REST APIs.

- **Solr**, another search server similar to Elasticsearch, offers features such as full-text search, database integration, and rich document handling. It operates through simple HTTP request URLs and returns responses in JSON format.

- **Lucene** serves as the core library underlying both Elasticsearch and Solr. It provides the fundamental functionality for indexing and searching documents, contributing to the fast search responses achieved by these systems.

Overall, Elasticsearch, Solr, and Lucene play crucial roles in the realm of search technology, providing robust solutions for various use cases.
