# Prevention of Sexual Harassment
## 1.What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
- **Comments About Physical Appearance**: Comments regarding an individual's physical appearance, especially when repeated or unwelcome, can be considered a form of sexual harassment in the workplace.

- **Verbal Harassment**: Saying inappropriate things, making jokes about someone's body or private parts, or saying derogatory things about their race, religion, or appearance can also constitute sexual harassment.

- **Stalking Through Digital Media**: This occurs when someone uses technology like phones, social media, or email to follow, bother, or scare another person. This includes sending inappropriate messages, images, or videos, as well as making offensive comments.

- **Non-Verbal Harassment**: This refers to behaviors that make someone feel uncomfortable, threatened, or disrespected without using words. It can include unwanted touching, invasion of personal space, or inappropriate gestures.

- **Quid Pro Quo**: This refers to a situation where someone in a position of authority requests or demands sexual favors from an employee or subordinate in exchange for job benefits, promotions, raises, or other favorable treatment.

## 2.What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
  
If I face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior, here's what I would do:
1. **Document**: I would document the details of the incident or incidents, including dates, times, locations, and descriptions of what happened. Having a record of the behavior can be important if I need to report it later.

2. **Speak Up**: If I feel safe and comfortable doing so, I would directly address the behavior with the person involved, expressing that their actions are inappropriate and unwelcome. Sometimes, people may not realize the impact of their behavior, and addressing it directly can help stop it.

3. **Seek Support**: I would seek support from trusted friends, family members, or colleagues who can provide emotional support and guidance on how to handle the situation. It's important to know that I'm not alone and that there are people who can help me navigate the process.

4. **Know My Rights**: I would familiarize myself with the organization's policies and procedures related to harassment and discrimination, as well as any applicable laws or regulations. Knowing my rights can empower me to advocate for myself and ensure that the behavior is addressed appropriately.

5. **Report**: I would report the behavior to the appropriate authorities or individuals within the organization, such as HR, a supervisor, or a designated harassment contact person. I would follow the organization's reporting procedures and provide as much detail as possible to ensure that appropriate action is taken.
